This Docusaurus project lives in a <a href='{{GITHUB_REPO_URL}}'
target='_blank'>Git repo</a> that was created just for you, and you’ve already
been added to it as a collaborator. To start experimenting with this site, you
just have to grab the Git repo and install dependencies.

## Step 1: Clone the Git Repo

First, clone the Git repo that contains the source code for this Docusaurus
site:

    git clone {{GITHUB_REPO_URL}}
    cd {{GITHUB_REPO_NAME}}


## Step 2: Install Dependencies and Build the Site

Then run the following commands to build a local copy of the website:

    cd website
    npm install
    npm start
  
You should now be able to navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser to view
the site.


## Next Steps

That’s it! You’re up and running. We’re ready to [make some
edits](/docs/edit-a-page).


### Additional Resources

This project follows the conventions of the Docusaurus starter project, so
you’ll find all of the <a href='https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation'
target='_blank'>official documentation</a> useful if you’re not familiar with
Docusaurus.
